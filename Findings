Summer is the peak season for both rider types.
Membership rider's trip is longer than casual ones regardless of the season or day.

6% of Casual riders return their bike to their start point station; 4% of Membership riders returns at their start point station.

<b>Analysis:</b>

It seems that the casual users travel the same average distance than the member users, but they have relatively longer rides, that would indicate a more leisure oriented usage vs a more "public transport" or pragmatic use of the bikes by the annual members.
Casual riders are more likely to return their bikes at the same station.
Additionally, membership riders are more active on weekdays, casual riders use the service more often over weekend. It lead me to conclude that membership riders use this service for their commute while casual rider use it for fun.


<b>Conclusion:</b>

1)The Casual users take leisure, and tourism rides mostly on weekends.

2)The Membership users usually have a commute during thhe weekday.
