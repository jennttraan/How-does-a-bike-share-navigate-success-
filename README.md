<center><b>Performed data analysis for a fictional bike share company.

<u>Background scenario</u></b></center>

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

<b>About the company</b>

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share company. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, The director of marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, she believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

<b>The goal of this case study</b>

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The director of marketing has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

<b>In this assignment, I will produce a report with the following deliverables:</b>

A clear statement of the business task

A description of all data sources used

Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data

A summary of my analysis

Supporting visualizations and key findings

<b>Ask</b>

Business Task In order to maximize the number of annual membership, I,the data analyst, will find trends and patterns among casual riders and membership riders, and identify potential riders who benefit from annual membership.

<b>About the data set:</b>

Since Cyclistic is a fictional company, I will use Divvy’s, a bike-share program based in Chicago, data from May 2020 – April 2021 to complete this case study. For the dataset plase click <a href="http://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">here</a>.
